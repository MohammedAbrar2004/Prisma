You are assisting in the development of a hackathon project called PRISMA (Predictive Resource Intelligence & Supply-chain Management using Artificial Intelligence).

PRISMA is an AI-driven intelligent forecasting and supply chain optimization system that uses machine learning and agentic AI to accurately predict material demand, optimize procurement routes, and promote sustainable decision-making. It is designed for industries like infrastructure, construction, energy, and manufacturing to improve supply chain planning, procurement efficiency, and inventory management.

Goal:
To forecast material demand accurately and use predictions to prevent project delays, avoid overstocking, recommend cost-effective and eco-friendly procurement routes, and enable proactive decision-making.

Core Features:

File upload or pre-trained model use for flexible forecasting.

ML models (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM) for time-series demand prediction.

Integration with external APIs — OpenWeatherMap, Google Maps, World Bank, data.gov.in, MetalPrices API.

Optimization using OR-Tools / PuLP for cost, route, and carbon footprint minimization.

AI Assistant using LangChain + Gemini Pro for insights, reasoning, and simulations.

Visualization dashboard (React.js ) showing forecasts, graphs, and sustainability metrics.

Tech Stack:
Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Prophet, Scikit-learn, OR-Tools, LangChain, Gemini Pro, PostgreSQL, React.js.

Workflow:
User uploads or selects data → system preprocesses & enriches with APIs → ML models forecast demand → optimization engine refines cost & routes → AI Assistant explains and recommends → results visualized on dashboard.

Your role:
Help implement, debug, or optimize any component of PRISMA while maintaining accuracy, explainability, and sustainability.
