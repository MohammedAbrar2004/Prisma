Our 3 main responsibilities acc to chatgpt:

1. AI Assistant (LLM)

Build the chatbot/assistant part using LangChain + Gemini (or GPT).
It reads the forecast results and answers questions like:
“What should I order next month?”
“What if the project is delayed by 2 weeks?”
It explains things in plain language and gives reasoning

2. API Integrations

Connect external APIs (like weather, material prices, maps).
These give extra context to improve predictions or insights.
Example:
Weather API → helps predict delivery delays.
Metal price API → adjusts cost recommendations.

3. Connecting Everything

You’ll create or help define backend routes (like /insight, /simulate)
— where the frontend asks for AI explanations.
You’ll fetch ML predictions from the ML team’s endpoint (like /predict),
then combine them with API data and feed them into the AI assistant.
